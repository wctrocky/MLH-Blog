Need Help Obtaining An Internship?

In this post I will highlight some of the things that have made me successful when trying to secure a summer internship. When I transferred to Winston-Salem State University, I received an internship offer from a fortune 100 company! I was in disbelief that I was going have a paid internship experience over the summer. 
<br>
<br>
One of the key things that I utilized to get my internship was career services. They offer many helpful services and want to help you learn about your skills and interests, and articulate them confidently in resumes, cover letters, interviews, and personal statements; identify and explore career options that you might pursue; and implement an effective strategy to attain your desired career outcomes. 
<br>
<br>
Although the first semester that I was there, there were still many COVID-19 restrictions. I still utilized all of the opportunities that were offered virtually such as resume reviews, mock interviews, and career fairs. Having a strong resume is critical. The staff were able to help me cater my resume to the internship that I was applying for. Making sure I had keywords that recruiters look for, updating my experience to not include jobs that I worked in high school. Mock interviews give you the chance to practice what your real-time interview may look like. You should take mock interviews seriously as if they were real. Some benefits of mock interviews are that they can help you reduce stress and anxiety about the real interview, help boost your confidence, provide you with useful feedback in a low pressure situation, and prepare you for behavioral-based interview questions.

Another key piece in getting your internship is doing your research. Showing interviewers what you know about the company will set you apart from other prospects. Research the company website, look at the company's social media accounts, research the hiring manager, and their interview process. By researching the company beforehand, it will allow you to tailor your answers to what the company may value or be looking for. It will also help you to formulate questions you may have about the company or position. You are also interviewing the company to see if they are a good fit for you. 
<br>
<br>
My last bit of advice which I kind of already touched on is to get involved. Participate in hackathons, virtual workshops and meetings, and programs that are offered. Things are not going to get handed to you, you have to go out and get what you want. Once you become involved, the doors and connections will start opening up for you.

I hope you have been able to take away something from my experiences and feel free to reach out if you have any more questions.
